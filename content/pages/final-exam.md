Directions: This exam is closed book. You are allowed three sheets of notes, front and back. No laptops or electronic communication devices are allowed in the exam. This includes cell phones. Calculators are allowed.

Unless otherwise specified, feel free to express vector answers in terms of any unit coordinate vectors defined in the problem. It is strongly recommended that you show your work in symbolic terms first before you substitute in numbers. This makes it more likely that we can award partial credit, when numerical errors crop up.

There is a total of 100 points on this quiz. You have 1.5 hours from when you start the quiz in which to work.
