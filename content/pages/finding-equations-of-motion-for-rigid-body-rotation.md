Covered this week:  
Week 7 emphasizes finding the equations of motion of rotating and translating rigid bodies. We introduce more complex problems and consider systems with more than one degree of freedom. We discuss how to cleverly select the point about which one computes torques and angular momentum and present examples. We use an important alternative form of Euler's torque equation.

### Problems and Concept Questions

Each problem set has concept questions paired with most problems. Answers to the concept questions are handed in before the overall problem set is due. You should therefore answer the concept questions in each problem set while watching the video lectures for the week. Then, use the Concept Question Answer Key (below in the {{% resource_link 9fdc3853-8645-b3ee-78bf-504125c7ccf2 "Check Yourself" "#cy" %}} section) to check your work before continuing to work on the problem set.

Please note that if your answer to the concept question is incorrect, it is likely that you may start down an unproductive pathway to a solution. Try to fully understand the answer to the concept question before you begin the regular problem.
