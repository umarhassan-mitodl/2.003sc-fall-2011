Covered this week:  
In week 2, we continue with the study of Newton's laws. We reviewed the third law and its application to finding the center of mass. Next, we take up the topic of kinematics in translating and rotating frames. In lecture 4, we do a series of examples where velocity and acceleration using polar and cylindrical coordinates, then ending with an introduction to normal and tangential unit vectors.

### Problems and Concept Questions

Each problem set has concept questions paired with most problems. Answers to the concept questions are handed in before the overall problem set is due. You should therefore answer the concept questions in each problem set while watching the video lectures for the week. Then, use the Concept Question Answer Key (below in the {{% resource_link d479c0ac-1170-243d-23ce-3aa59b83a427 "Check Yourself" "#cy" %}} section) to check your work before continuing to work on the problem set.

Please note that if your answer to the concept question is incorrect, it is likely that you may start down an unproductive pathway to a solution. Try to fully understand the answer to the concept question before you begin the regular problem.
