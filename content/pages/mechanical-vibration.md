Covered this week:  
The last several lectures deal with mechanical vibration. Up to now in the course considerable emphasis has been placed on finding equations of motion of mechanical systems. The study of vibration will emphasize the analysis of the solution of the equations of motion of a particularly important class of dynamics problems: the vibration of machines.

Balance scales are simple tools that can give the mass of an object relative to another object through finding the equilibrium point. Image courtesy of {{% resource_link "aca48a05-973f-49a8-b52b-b80dead0e2ae" "Lichfield District Council" %}} on Flickr.

### Problems and Concept Questions

Each problem set has concept questions paired with most problems. Answers to the concept questions are handed in before the overall problem set is due. You should therefore answer the concept questions in each problem set while watching the video lectures for the week. Then, use the Concept Question Answer Key (below in the {{% resource_link 56828116-6798-4acb-bfaa-7d752c91ca91 "Check Yourself" "#cy" %}} section) to check your work before continuing to work on the problem set.

Please note that if your answer to the concept question is incorrect, it is likely that you may start down an unproductive pathway to a solution. Try to fully understand the answer to the concept question before you begin the regular problem.

### Concept Question Answer Key and Problem Set Solutions

The solutions are presented in two files, one with the answers to the concept questions, and one with solutions and in-depth explanations for the problems. Work the problems on your own and check your answers when you're done.
